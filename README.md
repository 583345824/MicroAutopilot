# MicroAutopilot
This is about the design I made in 17 years, about the last mile delivery. Then, last year I did a structural design at a start-up company about the last mile distribution. Their engineers tried to run a simplified version of Apollo on the TX2. Binocular camera, 16-line laser radar, this should be a fairly cheap set of hardware, but such a set of MicroCar costs at least 50,000. So their boss told me at the time that you were doing the structure on the road of Australia, because the delivery fee in China could not support this kind of thing. However, considering my original design, he is targeting the environment of the school and the park. I am going to use tens of thousands of laser radars and Apollo. Would you like to write an autopilot framework yourself?
